NewsVolley
==========

This is a sample News application which fetches JSON responses from RESTful server using Google's Volley Library


Selection of Google's Volley Library has been done due to the following advantages:

0. Elegant processing, scheduling, caching, queuing and prioritization of Network requests
1. High-level APIs to make asynchronous RESTful HTTP requests
2. Parallel Downloads of Image files
3. Backward compatible(via Android Support Library)
4. Built-in Memory and Disk Cache

Taken care of following scenarios:

-> Used only Google supported libraries. No 3rd Party libs used
-> UI is consistent across all device screens both in Portrait and Landscape modes
-> Tested on GingerBird devices. Running smoothly with glitch, bug and crash free
-> Lazyload of Images in Listview
-> Used GIT for source control
-> Commented appropriately
-> Compliant to OO Design Patterns
